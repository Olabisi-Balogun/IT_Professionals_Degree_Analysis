# IT_Professionals_Degree_Analysis

## Installation:
Anaconda distribution is required and Python version 3

## Project Motivation:
This project analyzes the data collected from Stack
Overflow survey carried out in 2019. The project aims to investigate the
profile of working professionals in the IT industry based on their level
of education.The motivation for this project came from a popular
constant controversial debate on Twitter on not needing a college degree
to work in any specialized areas of IT. Due to my personal curiosity, I
decided to investigate if this is a founded claim or not.I wanted to see
what the data says to this effect.

## File Description:
The files used are the dataset folder which can be downloaded
from the link below and the python jupyter notebook contains the code for the analysis.
Visualization of analysis are saved as png files

## Running the Code:
If you want to run the code, change the file path presented to 
the path where you store the downloaded data.


## Outcome:
At the end of the analysis, it was deduced that having a degree
or any form of college experience plays a major role in getting a job in
the tech industry as more than 90% of professionals employed full-time
in the tech industry, according to the data from Stack Overflow,  have
some form of college experience.
